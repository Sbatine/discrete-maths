Create A Class SET. Create Member Functions To Perform The Following SET Operations:
1) Is Member: Check Whether An Element Belongs To The Set Or Not And Return Value As True/False.
2) Powerset: List All The Elements Of The Power Set Of A Set.
3) Subset: Check Whether One Set Is A Subset Of The Other Or Not.
4) Union And Intersection Of Two Sets.
5) Complement: Assume Universal Set As Per The Input Elements From The User.
6) Set Difference And Symmetric Difference Between Two Sets.
7) Cartesian Product Of Sets.
Write A Menu Driven Program To Perform The Above Functions On An Instance Of The SET Class.
