Write a Program to evaluate a polynomial function. (For example store f(x) = 4n* +
2n + 9 in an array and for a given value of n, say n = 5, compute the value of f(n)).


def solve_polynomial():
    coeffs = list(map(int, input("Enter your polynomial coefficients separated with space: ").split()))
    x = int(input("Enter the value of your variable: "))
    result = 0
    degree = len(coeffs) - 1

    for i, coef in enumerate(coeffs):
        result += coef * (x ** (degree - i))
    
    return result

print(solve_polynomial())

OUTPUT:
Enter your polynomial coefficients separated with space: 3 6 9 4
Enter the value of your variable: 3
166
